# Project Status Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Full Import  
**Database:** housing_db (PostgreSQL)  
**Current Records:** 84,469 properties (12 municipalities)

---

## 🎯 What We've Built

A comprehensive Danish housing market analysis system that:
- Imports property data from Boligsiden API
- Stores in PostgreSQL with 13 normalized tables
- Provides web interface for search and analysis
- Captures complete property history including listing dates and price changes

---

## 📊 Database Status

### Schema: 13 Tables (120+ fields total)
✅ **properties_new** - Core property data  
✅ **main_buildings** - Primary building details  
✅ **additional_buildings** - Garages, outbuildings  
✅ **registrations** - Sale transaction history  
✅ **municipalities** - Municipality data with tax rates  
✅ **provinces** - Regional information  
✅ **roads** - Street information  
✅ **zip_codes** - Postal codes  
✅ **cities** - City data  
✅ **places** - Neighborhoods  
✅ **days_on_market** - Market timing  
✅ **cases** - Listing cases with dates and status (NEW!)  
✅ **price_changes** - Price reduction history (NEW!)

### Current Import Status
- **Imported:** 84,469 properties from 12 municipalities
- **Ready to import:** 36 municipalities total (~150,000+ properties estimated)
- **Import speed:** ~9.4 properties/second with parallel processing

## 🔧 Recent Updates (October 6, 2025)

### 1. Schema Enhancement
- ✅ Added `cases` table for listing history
- ✅ Added `price_changes` table for price tracking
- ✅ Updated import functions to capture cases[] array
- ✅ Created tables in database

### 2. 10,000 Limit Fix
- ✅ Implemented zip code subdivision for large municipalities
- ✅ Auto-detects municipalities with >9,500 properties
- ✅ Discovers zip codes via API sampling
- ✅ Subdivides searches to capture all properties
- **Result:** København (14,368 villas) now fully accessible

### 3. Hidden Properties Discovery
- ✅ Documented HTML UUID extraction method
- ✅ Successfully found "hidden" properties not in search results
- ✅ Verified approach with Degnebakken 24 example
- **Use case:** Properties visible on website but not in API search

### 4. API Filter Research
- ✅ Tested status filtering capabilities
- ✅ Confirmed `sold=false` works (reduces by ~80%)
- ✅ Confirmed `isOnMarket` available in search results
- ✅ Documented that `status` field only in cases[], not search
- **Decision:** Import ALL properties, filter client-side

### 5. Project Cleanup
- ✅ Moved 19 test scripts to `tests/` folder
- ✅ Archived 5 old documentation files
- ✅ Updated PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md with latest findings
- ✅ Updated DATABASE_SCHEMA.md with new tables
- ✅ Created FILE_OVERVIEW.md for quick reference
- **Result:** Clean, organized project structure

## 🚀 Ready to Execute

### Next Step: Full Import
```bash
python import_copenhagen_area.py --parallel --workers 12
```

**What This Will Do:**
- Import all properties from 36 municipalities
- Use zip code subdivision for large municipalities (København, etc.)
- Capture ALL fields including cases[] and price_changes[]
- Import both sold and on-market properties
- Handle duplicates automatically
- Show progress with ETA

**Expected Results:**
- ~150,000+ total properties
- ~2-3 hours runtime
- Complete listing history with dates
- Full price change tracking
- 0 missed properties due to 10K limit

## 🎯 What We Can Now Track

With the enhanced schema, we can now answer:

1. **When was this property first listed?**
   → `cases.created_date`

2. **How long has it been on the market?**
   → `cases.days_on_market_current`

3. **How many times has the price been reduced?**
   → `COUNT(price_changes)` where `price_change_amount < 0`

4. **What's the total price drop?**
   → `SUM(price_changes.price_change_amount)`

5. **Is it currently for sale?**
   → `cases.status = 'open'` or `properties_new.is_on_market = true`

6. **What was the original asking price?**
   → `cases.original_price`

7. **Has it been sold before?**
   → `registrations` table + multiple `cases`

## 📊 Web Interface Status

### Currently Available:
✅ Modern animated landing page  
✅ Property search with filters  
✅ Sort by: price, size, year, price/m²  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Real-time API  

### To Be Added:
⏳ Display listing dates from `cases.created_date`  
⏳ Show price history from `price_changes`  
⏳ Filter by case status (open/sold/withdrawn)  
⏳ Days on market indicator  
⏳ Price reduction badges  

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

✅ **Complete API Coverage:** All fields captured including cases[]  
✅ **No Import Limits:** 10K limit bypassed with zip code subdivision  
✅ **Hidden Properties:** Method documented for non-searchable properties  
✅ **Performance:** 20x faster with parallel processing  
✅ **Data Quality:** Comprehensive validation and error handling  
✅ **Documentation:** Complete knowledge base and file references  
✅ **Clean Structure:** Organized folders and archived old files
