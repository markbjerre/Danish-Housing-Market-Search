# Property Scoring Model - Development TODO

**Created:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** Medium

---

## Overview

Develop a comprehensive scoring algorithm to rank properties based on weighted factors that represent value, quality, location, and potential.

---

## Phase 1: Research & Analysis ⏳

### 1.1 Market Analysis
- [ ] Analyze price per m² distribution across municipalities
- [ ] Identify price outliers (good deals vs overpriced)
- [ ] Study correlation between renovation year and price
- [ ] Analyze energy label impact on pricing
- [ ] Research basement area value contribution
- [ ] Study plot size vs price correlation

### 1.2 Feature Importance
- [ ] Calculate correlation matrix for all numeric features
- [ ] Identify most impactful features on property value
- [ ] Study feature combinations (e.g., large basement + recent renovation)
- [ ] Analyze geographic clustering patterns

### 1.3 User Preferences Survey
- [ ] Define target user personas (families, investors, retirees, etc.)
- [ ] Determine importance weights for each persona
- [ ] Create preset profiles for each persona type

## Phase 2: Scoring Algorithm Development 🎯

### 2.1 Normalize Features (0-10 scale)

**Price per m²** (Lower is better)
- [ ] Calculate municipality-specific benchmarks
- [ ] Define formula: `score = 10 - ((price_per_sqm - min) / (max - min)) * 10`
- [ ] Add premium adjustment for luxury areas (Gentofte, Frederiksberg)

**Living Area** (Larger is better, with diminishing returns)
- [ ] Small: 0-100 m² (linear 0-5 points)
- [ ] Medium: 100-200 m² (linear 5-8 points)
- [ ] Large: 200-300+ m² (logarithmic 8-10 points)

**Distance to Copenhagen** (Closer is better)
- [ ] 0-10 km: 10 points (city center)
- [ ] 10-20 km: 8 points (inner suburbs)
- [ ] 20-30 km: 6 points (middle suburbs)
- [ ] 30-40 km: 4 points (outer suburbs)
- [ ] 40-60 km: 2 points (distant)

**Basement Area**
- [ ] No basement: 0 points
- [ ] 50-100 m²: 3-5 points
- [ ] 100-150 m²: 5-7 points
- [ ] 150+ m²: 7-10 points

**Plot Size**
- [ ] 0-400 m²: 0-3 points (small)
- [ ] 400-800 m²: 3-7 points (medium)
- [ ] 800-1200 m²: 7-9 points (large)
- [ ] 1200+ m²: 9-10 points (very large)

**Bathrooms**
- [ ] 1 bathroom: 0 points
- [ ] 2 bathrooms: 5 points
- [ ] 3 bathrooms: 8 points
- [ ] 4+ bathrooms: 10 points

**Renovation Year** (More recent is better)
- [ ] Not renovated: 0 points
- [ ] Before 2000: 2 points
- [ ] 2000-2010: 4 points
- [ ] 2010-2015: 6 points
- [ ] 2015-2020: 8 points
- [ ] 2020+: 10 points

**Energy Label**
- [ ] A: 10 points
- [ ] B: 8 points
- [ ] C: 6 points
- [ ] D: 4 points
- [ ] E: 2 points
- [ ] F/G: 0 points

**Additional Factors to Consider:**
- [ ] Number of rooms (more is better, but watch for odd layouts)
- [ ] Number of floors (2 floors often preferred over 1 or 3+)
- [ ] Year built (historical value vs modern construction)
- [ ] External wall material (brick > concrete > wood)
- [ ] Heating type (district heating > heat pump > oil)
- [ ] Roof material (tile > metal > tarpaper)
- [ ] Municipality tax rates (lower is better)
- [ ] School availability (more schools = family-friendly)
- [ ] Days on market (longer = more negotiation potential)

### 2.2 Weighted Scoring Formula

```
Final Score = Σ(Feature_Score_i × Weight_i) / Σ(Weight_i) × 100
```

   - Plot: 8/10
   - Renovation: 8/10 ⭐
   - Distance: 8/10

3. **Location First** (Focus: Proximity to city)
   - Distance: 10/10 ⭐
   - Price per m²: 4/10
   - Area: 5/10
   - Bathrooms: 5/10
   - Renovation: 5/10
   - Energy: 4/10

4. **Family Oriented** (Focus: Space & schools)
   - Area: 9/10 ⭐
   - Plot: 8/10 ⭐
   - Bathrooms: 7/10
   - Rooms: 8/10
   - Schools (municipality): 6/10
   - Distance: 5/10
   - Price per m²: 5/10

5. **Eco-Conscious** (Focus: Sustainability)
   - Energy Label: 10/10 ⭐
   - Renovation Year: 8/10 ⭐
   - Heating Type: 7/10
   - Price per m²: 6/10
   - Distance (public transit): 7/10

## Notes

- Start with simple linear scoring, iterate to logarithmic/exponential if needed
- Keep scoring transparent - users should understand why a property scores high/low
- Allow full customization - users know their priorities best
- Monitor for gaming/manipulation of scores
- Consider adding "hidden gem" algorithm for undervalued properties
