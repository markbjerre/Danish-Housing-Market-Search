# Server Update - October 5, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **AttributeError: 'Property' object has no attribute 'days_on_market'**
- **Problem:** Code was accessing `prop.days_on_market` but the relationship is named `days_on_market_info`
- **Solution:** Changed all references from `prop.days_on_market` to `prop.days_on_market_info`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED - Server reloaded automatically

### 2. **Route Conflict: `/search` endpoint**
- **Problem:** Had two routes with same path `/search` - one for page, one for API
- **Solution:** 
  - Kept `/search` as the search page route
  - Changed API endpoint to `/api/search`
  - Updated frontend to call `/api/search?${params}`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### 3. **"Unexpected token '<'" Error**
- **Root Cause:** API endpoint was returning HTML error page (500 error) instead of JSON
- **Reason:** AttributeError was causing server to return error HTML
- **Solution:** Fixed the AttributeError above, now returns proper JSON
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
